# landing-page

This project is my attempt at the landing-page section of the Foundations course by The Odin Project.

The purpose of this project is to consolidate the new theory I have learnt around foundational CSS and Flexbox. By putting these styling methods into use, I hope to be able to creat my first aesthtically decent layout.
